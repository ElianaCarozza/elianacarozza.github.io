# About Me

I am a researcher at [IRIF](http://www.irif.fr) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale), Université Paris Cité, focusing on post-quantum cryptography. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, concentrating on code-based advanced primitives, which offer promising solutions for securing data in the quantum era.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests include signature schemes, zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, and MPC in the head, addressing both foundational and practical aspects of cryptography.
