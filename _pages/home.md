# About Me
I am a Post-Quantum Cryptography Engineer at [Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines](https://www.uvsq.fr/), within the **CRYPTO team**. As part of the national project *“Train Cyber Experts”* (initiative Compétences et Métiers d’Avenir – France 2030), in partnership with Institut Mines-Télécom, I am responsible for the conception and development of advanced academic dissemination modules in mathematics for cryptography and in cryptography itself.

In parallel, I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at [IPESUP](https://www.ipesup.fr/), a prestigious preparatory school where I specifically prepare students in the *"prépa MP2I"* (Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, and Computer Science) track for the competitive entrance exams to the top French engineering and business schools (Grandes Écoles).

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from [IRIF](http://www.irif.fr) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale), Université Paris Cité, where my research centered on advanced cryptographic primitives and digital signature schemes in the post-quantum setting.

I am proficient in programming languages such as **Python, C**, **OCaml** and **Java**, which I also teach in my computer science courses, with practical expertise in **implementing cryptographic algorithms**, honed during an internship at [CryptoExperts](https://www.cryptoexperts.com/).

# Research Interests
My primary research focuses on **digital signature schemes**, with particular emphasis on:

- **Code-Based Signature Schemes**: Developing efficient, secure, and quantum-resistant constructions based on the **Regular Syndrome Decoding (RSD)** problem.
- **Threshold Signature Schemes**: Extending classical signature schemes to enable collaborative signing while ensuring both security and efficiency.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoK)**: Designing compact and efficient ZK proof of knowledge in code-based settings, used to define signature schemes via Fiat-Shamir.
- **MPC-in-the-Head Protocols**: Innovating signature schemes by integrating Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques.
