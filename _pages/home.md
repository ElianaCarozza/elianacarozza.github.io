# About Me
I am a researcher at [IRIF](http://www.irif.fr) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale), Université Paris Cité, specializing in **post-quantum cryptography**. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, with a focus on **code-based advanced cryptographic primitives**, which offer promising solutions for securing data in the quantum era.

In addition to my research, I have extensive experience in teaching, having lectured on advanced topics in **mathematics** and **computer science**. I am also proficient in programming languages such as **Python, C**, and **Java**, with practical expertise in implementing cryptographic algorithms, honed during a **five-month internship** at [CryptoExpert](https://www.cryptoexperts.com/).

# Research Interests
My primary research focuses on **digital signature schemes**, with particular emphasis on:

- **Code-Based Signature Schemes**: Developing efficient, secure, and quantum-resistant constructions based on the **Regular Syndrome Decoding (RSD)** problem.
- **Threshold and Multisignature Schemes**: Extending classical signature schemes to enable collaborative signing while ensuring both security and scalability.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoK)**: Designing compact and efficient ZK proofs tailored to the needs of code-based cryptography.
- **MPC-in-the-Head Protocols**: Innovating signature schemes by integrating Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques, enabling lightweight implementations with robust security guarantees.

My recent contributions include optimizing existing code-based signature schemes by improving their structure and efficiency, as well as applying **Fiat-Shamir transformations** to reduce their size and enhance usability. These advancements have been recognized at international conferences such as **Asiacrypt** and **Eurocrypt**, where I had the privilege of presenting my work.
